			<h2>Who This Course Is For</h2>
			<div>
				<div class="heading-ans">
					<h6>While the real answer is: anyone who has a business or wants to start a business, I know that might be a bit too general. </h6>
					<p>Specifically I’ve helped clients and have seen great results for:</p>
				</div>
				<div class="-tips-box">
					<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>Pre Launch Companies</h4>
						<p>If you want to lay strong foundations, get out of the gate FAST, and speed past your competition… this is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach helped one of my pre-launch company clients become the go-to, most trusted, household name companies in her local area after less than a year in business. Seriously, if you go to that area and mention any other brand they’re looked at as, “dirty”. She’s DOMINATING - and is a room mom and hikes after brunch and workouts with her girlfriends in her free time, <!-- several times a week. --></p>
						</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>Pre Launch Companies</h4>
						<p>Want to take more market share, but don’t have the money or manpower that a lot of the older, leading brands in your space do? This is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach helped one of my challenger brand clients define their voice, erase the inconsistencies in their branding, and get higher market share selling in 48 out of 50 of the states in the US. She quit her corporate job, is able to take care of the elderly in her family, all while having time to have “me time” whenever she wants.</p>
						</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>Early Stage Brands</h4>
						<p>Looking to unite your company and consumer base so you can grow faster and align everyone in your company? This is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach helped one of my early stage brand clients determine exactly who his ideal clients were, create easier, more consistent and recurring revenue by designing automation around exactly what his customer wanted and therefore created more freedom for himself to spend time golfing and traveling with his son and daughter. </p>
						</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>Established Brands</h4>
						<p>Has growth plateaued and you’re looking for a breakthrough? This is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach helped an established brand that dominated the area become more clear on exactly who their most profitable customers were, how to attract them to make them even more loyal and create a *real* purpose that drives decision making throughout the company, solving 90% of their problems before they even becoming problems and releasing them to finally have freedom FROM their business to spending time ACTUALLY LIVING instead of being a slave to their work. </p>
						</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>In-House Teams</h4>
						<p>Looking to more intimately connect with your target market and figure out exactly what they want so you can expand (and let’s be real - dominate!)? This is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach has helped a small tech team and a private equity holding company simplify their brands, figure out how to attract the most profitable customers in their niche, bring on additional founders and team members, while consistently paying everyone *a lot* <!--- more than before. </p>
							 <br>
							<p>Did I mention that with having a brand that *actually* works and does what it’s supposed to do they were able to raise about ***$2MILLION*** within the first **3 days** after launching their new brand? When a brand works - it just works and the “hustle” and “overwhelm” becomes less by default. You don’t need more hustle. You’re a pro at that, I’m sure of it. And you certainly don’t need any more overwhelm or “bandaids” on your biz to make it better. </p>
						</span> 
						<p> -->
							You need a brand that works - and for it to work it HAS to go through the branding process. You can’t just slap it together.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="tips">
					<div class="tip">
						<h4>Pre-Teens & Teens</h4>
						<p>Looking to give your not so little kiddo a head start in life by teaching them how to be independent, responsible and give them *LOADS* of self confidence in doing it? Worried your kiddo might be put in a spot where they one day may have to work for someone who will require them to compromise their beliefs? This is for you!</p>
						<span>
							<p>My approach has helped several sibling teams start up a company, starting with what they believe and the problems they want to solve in the world. Imagine the world’s problems being solved through children’s eyes. This is literally what’s happening! <!---They’re selling their products and services to their neighborhoods,  sports teams and parents’ network of trusted friends and now have enough to buy their own first cars - plus college is halfway paid for at this point.</p>
							<br>
							<p>If this course is literally easy enough for them to implement, you can SURELY find the same (or better!) success!</p> -->

			<h2>Your Electrified 30-Day Guarantee</h2>

				<div>
					<p>I KNOW the information inside of this course works. I’ve used it myself and I’ve used it to help many entrepreneurs… but it only works if you do the work. That’s why I want to make you an iron clad guarantee and offer: invest in the course today and try it out. If after 30 days you’ve implemented my teachings inside the course with no results, just reach out to me and I’ll refund you every. single. penny. </p>
